# Messenger Stats
random stats for fb messenger messages! 
work in progress, please excuse my inelegant code. 


To count raw total and frequency distribution of messenger reaccs used by each person:
1. download messenger data from Facebook settings (this might take a while!)
2. replace paths with path to your directory containing messenger data
3. bug all your friends with this useless but fun data!
